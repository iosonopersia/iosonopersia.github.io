`Week from Aug 03 to Aug 09`

# Introduction
This is the first weekly report related to my proceedings in the [OpenCitations][opencitations] post-degree [research scholarship][research_scholarship] I'm currently involved in. \\
The research project, lead by professor [Silvio Peroni][essepuntato] from University of Bologna and funded by the [Wellcome Trust][wellcome], will take 5 months starting from August and ending on December 2020. \\
Each week, starting from now, I'm going to publish a detailed report keeping track of every progress made since the previous one.

# Report
The first week was fully dedicated to the reading of many resources regarding the OpenCitations project and its outcomes. The goal was to achieve a better comprehension of the OC effort, what has already been done and what has not been done yet. This will be very useful in the next weeks when I'll be working with pre-existing OC technologies, as knowing in advance _what_ they were made for and _how_ they're supposed to work will surely provide me a smoother experience.

## Articles
During the week I read many scholar papers suggested by prof. Peroni. In particular, I studied the following articles:

## Videos
I watched the following YouTube videos, which I found to be useful:

## Other resources
In addition to this, I also had an initial look at the source code provided in the [CCC GitHub repository][ccc_repo] and I started studying Python libraries such as [unittest][unittest] (for unit-testing) and [threading][threading] (for providing multithreading capabilities to the script).
