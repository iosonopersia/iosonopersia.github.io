`Week from Aug 24 to Aug 30`

# Introduction
During the fourth week I continued working on the [oc_ocdm project][oc_ocdm_github].
  * I fixed some issues in the source code
  * I completed the code refactoring of `dataset.py` and `distribution.py` (which will be added to the online repository as soon as possible)
  * I verified that the `oc_ocdm` package can be used in place of the original `graphlib.py` module without causing integration errors
    with the CCC workflow (namely the BEE and the SPACIN software)
  
# Report

## Fixed some issues
Firstly, I checked the entire codebase of `oc_ocdm` while comparing it with the documentation provided by the [OCDM][ocdm-2.0.1], looking
for potential implementation mistakes. I found the following two methods, both added last week, whose parameter was of the type `str` whilst it 
should have been of type `URIRef`, since the documentation refers neither to a `literal` nor to a `string`.

__ResourceEmbodiment__
  * has_url
  * has_media_type

Moreover, I found some little inconsistencies in the [OCDM][ocdm-2.0.1] itself, which I signalled by opening some GitHub issues ([#3][issue3], [#4][issue4], [#5][issue5], [#6][issue6]) in the [opencitations/metadata repository][metadata_repo].

## Dataset and Distribution code cleaning
I finished cleaning up `Dataset` and `Distribution` classes, moving some functions into the right class and documenting every method with short 
comments. The `Distribution` class now internally works in a very similar fashion to the other classes of [oc_ocdm][oc_ocdm_github],
storing its `URIRef` reference as `self.res`.

## Integration test with BEE and SPACIN
I decided to run a test to verify whether the [oc_ocdm][oc_ocdm_github] package could have been used as a drop-in replacement for the 
original `graphlib.py` module. In the [CCC repository][ccc] where it's located, `graphlib.py` is used primarily by [SPACIN][spacin]. In the 
OpenCitations workflow, SPACIN is a software which is intended to be launched with (or after) another software called [BEE][bee]. Hence, I
cloned the [CCC repository][ccc] locally and I removed from it the file `graphlib.py`. Then, I changed every import statement from within SPACIN 
and BEE source files in order for them to point at the globally installed `oc_ocdm` package. When everything was ready, I firstly launched 
BEE to produce the JSON-LD files that SPACIN consumes and then I launched SPACIN itself, hoping everything will run smoothly without throwing
exceptions. In the end, I got 3 different exceptions:
  1. the first one was caused by a very little bug in the `ProvSet` class, which I fixed immediately with [this commit][self_g_prov_commit]
  2. the second exception was thrown because the `jats2oc.py` module from SPACIN assumes that `DiscourseElement` objects have a "create_number" method [see jats2oc.py, line 1666][jats2oc_1666] (while this is not documented in the [OCDM][ocdm-2.0.1])
  3. the third exception was thrown because the `jats2oc.py` module from SPACIN assumes that `ReferencePointer` objects have a "has_next_de" method [see jats2oc.py, line 1568][jats2oc_1568] (while the `ReferencePointer` class already has a "has_next_rp" method which does the same thing)

While the first one was already fixed and the third one should be easily fixed just by changing line 1568 of `jats2oc.py` from
``` python
    cur_rp.has_next_de(next_rp)
```
to
``` python
    cur_rp.has_next_rp(next_rp)
```
, the second one requires a review of the [OCDM][ocdm-2.0.1] to be properly handled.
